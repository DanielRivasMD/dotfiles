## 2. Variables and Collections
####################################################

# You don't declare variables before assigning to them.
someVar = 5  # => 5
someVar  # => 5

# Accessing a previously unassigned variable is an error
try
    someOtherVar  # => ERROR: UndefVarError: someOtherVar not defined
catch e
    println(e)
end

# Variable names start with a letter or underscore.
# After that, you can use letters, digits, underscores, and exclamation points.
SomeOtherVar123! = 6  # => 6

# You can also use certain unicode characters
â˜ƒ = 8  # => 8
# These are especially handy for mathematical notation
2 * Ï€ # => 6.283185307179586

# A note on naming conventions in Julia:
#
# * Word separation can be indicated by underscores ('_'), but use of
#   underscores is discouraged unless the name would be hard to read
#   otherwise.
#
# * Names of Types begin with a capital letter and word separation is shown
#   with CamelCase instead of underscores.
#
# * Names of functions and macros are in lower case, without underscores.
#
# * Functions that modify their inputs have names that end in !. These
#   functions are sometimes called mutating functions or in-place functions.

# Arrays store a sequence of values indexed by integers 1 through n:
a = Int64[] # => 0-element Array{Int64,1}

# 1-dimensional array literals can be written with comma-separated values.
b = [4, 5, 6] # => 3-element Array{Int64,1}: [4, 5, 6]
b = [4; 5; 6] # => 3-element Array{Int64,1}: [4, 5, 6]
b[1]    # => 4
b[end]  # => 6

# 2-dimensional arrays use space-separated values and semicolon-separated rows.
matrix = [1 2; 3 4] # => 2Ã—2 Array{Int64,2}: [1 2; 3 4]

# Arrays of a particular type
b = Int8[4, 5, 6] # => 3-element Array{Int8,1}: [4, 5, 6]

# Add stuff to the end of a list with push! and append!
# By convention, the exclamation mark '!'' is appended to names of functions
# that modify their arguments
push!(a, 1)    # => [1]
push!(a, 2)    # => [1,2]
push!(a, 4)    # => [1,2,4]
push!(a, 3)    # => [1,2,4,3]
append!(a, b)  # => [1,2,4,3,4,5,6]

# Remove from the end with pop
pop!(b)  # => 6
b # => [4,5]

# Let's put it back
push!(b, 6)  # => [4,5,6]
b # => [4,5,6]

a[1]  # => 1  # remember that Julia indexes from 1, not 0!

# end is a shorthand for the last index. It can be used in any
# indexing expression
a[end]  # => 6

# we also have popfirst! and pushfirst!
popfirst!(a)  # => 1 
a # => [2,4,3,4,5,6]
pushfirst!(a, 7)  # => [7,2,4,3,4,5,6]
a # => [7,2,4,3,4,5,6]

# Function names that end in exclamations points indicate that they modify
# their argument.

sort(arr)   # => [4,5,6]
arr         # => [5,4,6]
sort!(arr)  # => [4,5,6]
arr         # => [4,5,6]

# Looking out of bounds is a BoundsError
