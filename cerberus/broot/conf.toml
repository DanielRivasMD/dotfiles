# Default flags
# You can set up flags you want broot to start with by
# default, for example `default_flags="ihp"` if you usually want
# to see hidden and gitignored files and the permissions (then
# if you don't want the hidden files you can launch `br -H`)
# A popular flag is the `g` one which displays git related info.

# Verbs and shortcuts

# If $EDITOR isn't set on your computer, you should either set it using
#  something similar to
#   export EDITOR=/usr/bin/nvim
#  or just replace it with your editor of choice in the 'execution'
#  pattern.
# Example:
#  execution = "/usr/bin/nvim {file}"
#
